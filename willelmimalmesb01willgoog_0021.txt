desect in the plan pursued by Malmesbury in his
History,-a fault of design rather than of inad-
vertence. Fearful lest his work should assume the
character ofa chronicle, he fell into the opposite
extreme, and frequently relatas circumstances
without stating the exact year in which they
occurred. He did this either in imitation of the
Roman writers or for the purpose of avoiding
the difficulty of fixing each transaction to a par-
ticular year, there being such frequent discre-
pancies on those points in the sources whence he
derived his information. It was not the custom
of the Saxons to be very exact as to dates in
their annals. In some copies os that invaluable
relic-the Saxon chronicis-events are recorded
as occurring in given yearS, while in other copies
the same events are referred to different years.
But these discrepancies may now be easily re-
medied, as they arose from the fact of the au-
thors of the chronicles commencing the year
at different periods. At Peterborough, and the
other monasteries founded by Aethelwold, the
year was commenced on the aeth of Maroh; but
at worcester, and the monasterias founded by
Osuuald, it was considered to begin on the 25th
of December: thus, transactions that occurred
between Christmasday and Lady-day are fre·

ChronicleS, referred to different years. The
chronology os Asser, in his Life of Aelfred the
Great, is occasionally inexact, as he sometimes
states that Aelfred commenced his reign in one
year, at other times in a different year. Aethel-

terminationes the, reigns of many of the Saxon
monarchs different from those assigned in the ¹
Saxon Chronicles. These writers, taking as the
