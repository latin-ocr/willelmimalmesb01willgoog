from a MS. written towards the close of the
twelfth century, which formerly belonged to the
abbey of Margan, founded by Robert earl cf
Gloucester, the nobleman to whom Malmes-
hury dedicated his work. This magnificent MS.
now preserved among the Royal manuscripts in
the British Museum, (Bihl. Reg.13. D. 11.) was
selected, after a careful examination and com-
parison with other manuscripts, because it was
found not only to be the least corrupted, but '
to coutain proofs of the author's latest correc-
tions. The only other MS. which agrees with
the Royal Manuscript, though not so ancient by
some centurias, is in the collection of Sir Thomas
Phillipps, Bart. From the various readings,
and from many important alterations observable
throughout, it is certain that the author made
several corrections in his work after he had com-
pleted it; and it is believed that traces may be
found of at least four distinct classes of copies of
the ‘Gesta Regum Anglorum,' and of two of the
‘Historia Novella? No one can examine the
various readings in the font-notes of this edition
without coming to the conclusion that the author
was constantly employed in the correction and

ations, it is true, are merely verbal; but they
contributa greatly to the elegance of his dic-
tion. In some places severe expressions are mo·
dified and softened, whole passages are added,
