have been shown: bnt it will be sufficient to state
that those variations only have hecn regarded

riation has been clearly an error attributable to
the copyist of the Ms. and not peculiar to any
particular class, it has not been thought neces-
sary to increase the notes by inserting it. There
ie, however, one exception to this rule. Every
word in the manuscript upon which the present
text is formed has been saithfnlly preserved,

supplied from other MSS. has been inserted in ,
the text, and the error noticed, with the autho·
rity upon which the amendment was made: hut
so correct is the MS. in question, that these in·
stances are very rare.

of manuscripts, to one of which classes every
