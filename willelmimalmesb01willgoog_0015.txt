he silent of Aethelweard, a noble and illustrious
man, who attempted to render these chronieles
into Latin3 his object Ι could applaud, if his
style did not disgust. Nor have I forgotten
Eadmer's work, written iu temperate graeeful
language, in which he takes a cursory glancc at
the times from Eadgar to William the First3
and thence, taking a wider field, brings his co-
pious and useful history down to the death of
Archhishop Anselm.¹ So that, from the time os
Beda, there is a period of two hundred and
twenty-three years of which there is no history:
thus the regular. series' of time halts in the
middle, from want of a connected relation.
Wherefore, as well out of love of my country as
out of respect to those who have enjoined me* to
the undertaking, I have been induced to fill up
the chasm, seasoning my crude materials with
Roman salt3 and, that my design mayproceed
withgreater regularity, I shall cull somewhat
from Beda, to whom Ι must often refer, glaneing
at some few things, hut omitting more.’

Saxon Laws, Asser, Aethelweard, Eadmer, Os-

writers, original charterS, letterS, and official
documents.²
