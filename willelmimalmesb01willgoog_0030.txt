'Phe Editor cannot conclude these remarks
without naming his brother, ΜΓ. william Harey,
to whom he is indebted for constant and valuable

assistance in collating manuscripts, and correct·
ing the press. Had that assistance been ren·
dered by a stranger, he should certainly not
have been satisfied with so inadequate un ac·
knowledgement.
