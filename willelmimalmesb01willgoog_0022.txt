basis of their history the copy of the chronicles
which they bad consulted, followed it, having no
sufficient means of testing the correctness of the
dates. Each monastery in the respective king-

doms of the heptarchy undoubtedly had an officer

the memorable oeconomos, not only in tbe king·

obvious discrepancies, and was unable satisfac·

plan which seldom required him to affix the ex·

he has given the year, betrayed him into ana·
chronism3 and, in oue or two instances, he has
actually made the event precede the cause. To
remedy this defect in some degree, and supply
