Pontificum! Iu dedicating his work to Queen
Elizaheth, Sir Henry Savile passed this just eu·
logy on Malmesbury: ‘Inter quos cum 11111-
rationis fide, et judicii maturitate, principem lo-
cum teneat (1111111111Μ111111111111111,11111,

gentorum plus minus annorum res tanta fide et
diligentia pertexuit ut e nostris prope solus his·
torici munus explesse videatur.'¹
, The manuscript from which Savile's edition
was printed was either carelessly transcribed, or
the volume was incorrectly printed: the text
ahounds with gross errors, which the tahle of
errata printed at the end of the work very inade-
quately remedies. From occasional notices in

more than one manuscript: hut instead 11 having
followed any one in particular, he seems to have
formed his text from several. The present
Editor has not met with any manuscript which
entirely agrees with Savile’s text: the Royal
MS. in the British Museum, 13. B. 11111. comes
nearest to it, hut does not thoroughly agree
with it. Savile has no authority 111 dividing
his work into chapters3 but his sections are
nearly the same as those found' rn the hest ma·
