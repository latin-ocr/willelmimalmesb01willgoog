only from the purest principles of justice and
duty, without pride, passion, or sellish ambi-
tion. Had he aspired to the throne when the
nation had grown tired of Matilda and Ste-
phen, he might possiblyhave gained it; but he
chose rather to preserve his fidelity and honour

have thoroughly imhihed it.'
